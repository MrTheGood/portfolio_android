 * Based on https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture-components/blob/master/GithubBrowserSample/app/src/main/java/com/android/example/github/vo/Resource.kt
 *
 * A generic class that holds a value with its state.
 * This allows the possibility to still retain the data, even while it's loading, or after an error occurred.
 * The reasoning behind this is that, during pagination loading, the data still exists while it's loading.
 * Or an error might not actually be a breaking error, but simply a lost connection, which does not mean all data should be thrown away.
 *
 * @param data The data in this [Resource]
 * @param error An error, if any
 * @param D The type of [data] this [Resource] can contain
 * @param E The type of [error] this [Resource] can contain
