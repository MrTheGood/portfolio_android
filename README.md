# portfolio_android
My personal portfolio app written in Kotlin Multiplatform for Android.

## Why make a KMP Portfolio app?
I originally started this project for the fun of making it, and to get a better grasp of Android and Kotlin development.
Later, I decided to rewrite it to solve some bad decisions I took in the initial development, but simply solving them ended up being too much work so I decided to redesign and rewrite it again. When I was nearly finished redesigning it, I decided to change the design again, which resulted in some required data changes in the database, which resulted in me having to rethink the logic. Around this time I decided that I needed a project in which I could figure out what works really well in terms of architecture, so that is what this project became. Halfway through that I decided that I should make it use Kotlin Multiplatform which triggered another remake. 
Now more than 2 and a half years after the initial commit and more than 1 year after the decision to remake this app, I have finally finished what I now call version 4.0.
