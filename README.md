# portfolio_android
My portfolio in the form of an Android app. 
I made this mostly for the fun of making it, but to get a better grasp of Android and Kotlin development. 

I am currently brainstorming a version 2.0 where I am going to adress some bad decisions and create a more unique feel for the app.
The most important plans for v2.0 are:
* A new design for the app that has more personality and uniqueness. 
* A complete remake of the entire code base to fix most of the bad decisions I made like: not properly recycling views, not having a clear app architecture, not using the really handy Android Architecture Components, and many more. 
* Experiment with the new Navigation components (Android Studio 3.2 required)
